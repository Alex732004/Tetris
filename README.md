Tetris is a puzzle video game originally designed and programmed by game designer Alexey Pajitnov in 1985. The gameâ€™s objective is to manipulate a series of tetrominoes, shapes composed of four square blocks each, by moving them sideways and rotating them in 90-degree increments with the aim of creating a horizontal line of blocks without gaps. When such a line is created, it disappears, and any block above the deleted line will fall. Players earn points for completing lines and can advance through levels, which increase the speed at which the tetrominoes fall, making the game progressively more challenging. The game ends when the playing field is filled to the point that no new tetrominoes can enter.
